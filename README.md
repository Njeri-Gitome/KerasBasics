# Keras
Keras is an open-source library that provides a Python interface for artificial neural networks. Keras acts as an interface for the TensorFlow library.

## What is Keras used for?
Keras is a high-level, deep learning API developed by Google for implementing neural networks.
It is written in Python and is used to make the implementation of neural networks easy.
It also supports multiple backend neural network computation.

### Keras vs Tensorflow
TensorFlow is an open-sourced end-to-end platform, a library for multiple machine learning tasks, while Keras is a high-level neural network library that runs on top of TensorFlow.
